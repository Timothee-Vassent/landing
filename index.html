 <img src="images/Profile.jpg" alt="Timothée Vassent">
 <p>Our guide Timothée Vassent accompanies and guides you during your hikes through several wonderful destinations. He will make you discover magnificent walks and different mountain ranges that make the beauty of the French landscapes. So he came up with the idea of setting up his own guide agency for tourists who wanted to hike quietly. Accustomed to large green spaces, he developed this passion for mountains and hiking during his vacations in order to explore its gigantic places, a little closer to the clouds, sun and stars. </p>
